### Project Description
The Legal Advisor is a web-based platform that helps users access quick and reliable legal advice by selecting a legal category and providing keywords related to their issue. The system retrieves relevant legal guidance from a structured database, ensuring users receive category-specific advice instantly.

### The Problem Statement
Many individuals and businesses face difficulties in accessing quick, affordable, and reliable legal information. Existing legal consultation services often require significant time and money. The lack of accessible legal guidance can lead to uninformed decisions, legal violations, and unnecessary disputes.

The proposed Legal Advisory System will allow users to:
- Select a legal category (e.g., business law, family law, criminal law, etc.).
- Enter their legal issue or keywords (e.g., ‚Äúcontract fraud,‚Äù ‚Äúpollution laws‚Äù).
- Retrieve legal advice from a structured database.

The system ensures that the retrieved legal advice aligns with the selected category and provides a relevant response based on the user's input.

### The Solution
Our solution is a **fast, user-friendly, and accessible legal advisory system** that:
- Uses a **structured Firestore database** to store legal laws and advice.
- Implements a **Node.js backend** that filters legal advice based on user input.
- Provides a **simple front-end** where users can enter their legal issues and get relevant advice instantly.
- **No AI required!** The system relies on predefined legal data and keyword-based matching.
